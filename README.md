# Part 1

### Directory Structure
```
Part 1
├── Copies
│   └── newfile_reverse.txt
├── main.c
├── main.h
└── newfile.txt

```

### Input
Input will be the filename and it will be given from command line and not stdin.

### Note
"newfile.txt" is just taken as an example here. Filename can be anything (without white space characters). <br>
Test your program with files of size of at least a few GBs. It is expected to run in around a minute at most.

# Part 2

### Directory Structure
```
Part 2
├── main.c
└── main.h

```

### Input
The string input will be given from command line and not from stdin.

### Note
Running program multiple times will print the output of two processes in seemingly random order, this is expected and not an error.
